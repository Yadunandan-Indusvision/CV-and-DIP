# DIP_and_CV

## Digital Image Processing and Computer Vision Concepts covered here are:

### 1. **Image Processing Fundamentals**

- Creating basic shapes (line, rectangle, circle, ellipse) and patterns (Black and White Patterns, Gradients) using numpy.zeros(height,width)
- Color Spaces (RGB,Grayscale,HSV,YCrCb and Complements of images) and Channel Representation (RGB colour channels and their Grayscale views)
- Bit Planes (binary representation of an image)
- Sampling and Quantization 
- Image Thresholding (segmentation of image using Global, Otsu and Adaptive thresholding)

### 2. **Image Enhancement and Analysis**

- Smoothing (Mean, Median, Gaussian filters), Sharpening (Laplacian filter, Unsharp Mask), High pass-low pass filters and high-boost filtering
- Types of Noise and Noise Reduction using smoothing filters 
- Histogram Equalization 
- Edge Detection (Sobel, Canny, Prewitt, Robert)
- Contour Detection features like:
  1. Moments
  2. Area
  3. Perimeter
  4. Contour Approximation
  5. Convex Hull
  6. Bounding Rectangle
  7. Minimum Enclosing Circle/Ellipse/Line that fits the object in the image
- Template Matching
- Connected Component Analysis

### 3. **Image Transformations and Object Tracking**

- Geometric and Morphological Transformations
- Homography and Projective Geometry
- Background Subtraction
- Object Tracking using techniques like MeanShift, CamShift, Kalman Filters, SORT, and DeepSORT (it dint work)
- Feature Discriptors (SIFT, SURF, ORB) (SURF is patented so it needs a paid opencv library
